        <p>
            The King of a small country invites 1000 senators to his annual party. As a tradition, each senator brings the King a bottle of wine.
            Soon after, the Queen discovers that one of the senators is trying to assassinate the King by giving him a bottle of poisoned wine.
            The King can only do one round of testing the bottles before the party the following day, as the poison takes 24 hours to kill the drinker.
            <br><br>
            The King is willing to risk the lives of the kingdom's prisoners but would prefer to use the least amount of prisoners possible to find the poisoned bottle.
            <br><br>
            What is the lowest number of prisoners required to find the bottle with only one round of testing?
            <br><br>
            Additionally, the King would like to double his number of senators to expand his land and would like to test the bottles every year.
            What is the new minimum number of prisoners that would be required to test the bottles now?
            <br><br>
            <strong>The answer should be the two numbers concatenated.</strong>
